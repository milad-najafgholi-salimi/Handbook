As the name suggests, Quicksort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms.

The Quicksort algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it.

In this tutorial the last element of the array is chosen to be the pivot element, but we could also have chosen the first element of the array, or any element in the array really.

Then, the Quicksort algorithm does the same operation recursively on the sub-arrays to the left and right side of the pivot element. This continues until the array is sorted.

>**Recursion** is when a function calls itself.
 After the Quicksort algorithm has put the pivot element in between a sub-array with lower values on the left side, and a sub-array with higher values on the right side, the algorithm calls itself twice, so that Quicksort runs again for the sub-array on the left side, and for the sub-array on the right side. The Quicksort algorithm continues to call itself until the sub-arrays are too small to be sorted.

**How it works:**

1. Choose a value in the array to be the pivot element.
2. Order the rest of the array so that lower values than the pivot element are on the left, and higher values are on the right.
3. Swap the pivot element with the first element of the higher values so that the pivot element lands in between the lower and higher values.
4. Do the same operations (recursively) for the sub-arrays on the left and right side of the pivot element.

```
def partition(array, low, high):
  pivot = array[high]
  i = low - 1

  for j in range(low, high):
     if array[j] <= pivot:
       i += 1
       array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i]

  array[i+1], array[high] = array[high], array[i+1]
  return i+1

def quicksort(array, low=0, high=None):
  if high is None:
    high = len(array) - 1

  if low < high:
    pivot_index = partition(array, low, high)
    quicksort(array, low, pivot_index-1)
    quicksort(array, pivot_index+1, high)

mylist = [64, 34, 25, 5, 22, 11, 90, 12]
quicksort(mylist)
print(mylist)

#Output:
[5, 11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

## Quicksort Time Complexity

The worst case scenario for Quicksort is $O(n^2)$. This is when the pivot element is either the highest or lowest value in every sub-array, which leads to a lot of recursive calls. With our implementation above, this happens when the array is already sorted.

But on average, the time complexity for Quicksort is actually just $O(nlogn)$, which is a lot better than for the previous sorting algorithms we have looked at. That is why Quicksort is so popular.

The recursion part of the Quicksort algorithm is actually a reason why the average sorting scenario is so fast, because for good picks of the pivot element, the array will be split in half somewhat evenly each time the algorithm calls itself. So the number of recursive calls do not double, even if the number of values `n` double.
